## 6. ASSEMBLY INFORMATION

*   **Assembly Sequence:** Not explicitly detailed. An "Engine Assembly" part (P21) is listed in the BOM, suggesting a top-level assembly.
*   **Key Assembly Points:** No specific instructions are provided.
*   **Component Relationships:** The overall exploded view on Page 2 shows how components fit together.
*   **Exploded View Details:** Page 2 provides a clear exploded view of the car engine, with numbered components corresponding to the BOM. This view is critical for understanding how parts connect.

## 7. QUALITY & MANUFACTURING NOTES

*   **Special Instructions:**
    *   "REMOVE ALL SHARP CORNERS" (General Note on all pages). This is a critical manufacturing instruction for safety and assembly.
    *   "DO NOT SCALE THIS DRAWING IF IN DOUBT, PLEASE ASK DESIGN TEAM" (General Note on all pages). Emphasizes reliance on dimensions, not visual scaling.

*   **Quality Requirements:** Not explicitly detailed beyond general notes.

*   **Testing Requirements:** None specified.

*   **Any Warnings or Cautions:** None explicitly stated, other than the general note to ask the design team if in doubt.

*   **Manufacturing Notes:** The "MIX" material and "MIX" finish designations are generic. In a real-world scenario, these would be replaced with specific material grades (e.g., Aluminum Alloy 6061-T6) and finishing processes (e.g., Anodized, Painted). The current notation suggests these are placeholders or that the material and finish are not yet finalized or are generic for the purpose of this documentation.
